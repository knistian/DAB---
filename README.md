2018-08-28: DAB(Digital Audio Broadcast) jammer 
* Analyce DAB droadcasting and find the best way to sabotage transmitions with use of strategicaly timed short radiopulses to 
reduse reception quality or deny reseption.

Strategy: Use network of smal, simple units, with very limited jamming time, and rely on a large number of distributed jammers, 
that only are active in very short periodes(pulses) to reduce chance of tracking. Instead of one jammer sending pulses continualy, 
it is a combined effort of the whole jammer network, and jammer pulses will come out of sequence from a randim individual or 
a few individual units at a time. Lower the ability to trace one individual jammer and take it out by the DAB authorities.


Part of system:
* DAB-receiver/sync-mecanism, to be able to time the jamming to maximise destructive effect om the DAB packages.
* Radio-pulse best suited to make the DAB-data-package readable by the DAB-receiver. (Timeing, Duration, Frequency-content)
